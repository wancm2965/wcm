/* Description of constants:
 *
 * Npc - is the number of look-up values available for the lowpass filter
 *    between the beginning of its impulse response and the "cutoff time"
 *    of the filter.  The cutoff time is defined as the reciprocal of the
 *    lowpass-filter cut off frequence in Hz.  For example, if the
 *    lowpass filter were a sinc function, Npc would be the index of the
 *    impulse-response lookup-table corresponding to the first zero-
 *    crossing of the sinc function.  (The inverse first zero-crossing
 *    time of a sinc function equals its nominal cutoff frequency in Hz.)
 *    Npc must be a power of 2 due to the details of the current
 *    implementation. The default value of 512 is sufficiently high that
 *    using linear interpolation to fill in between the table entries
 *    gives approximately 16-bit accuracy in filter coefficients.
 *
 * Nhc - is log base 2 of Npc.
 *
 * Na - is the number of bits devoted to linear interpolation of the
 *    filter coefficients.
 *
 * Np - is Na + Nhc, the number of bits to the right of the binary point
 *    in the integer "time" variable. To the left of the point, it indexes
 *    the input array (X), and to the right, it is interpreted as a number
 *    between 0 and 1 sample of the input X.  Np must be less than 16 in
 *    this implementation.
 *
 * Nh - is the number of bits in the filter coefficients. The sum of Nh and
 *    the number of bits in the input data (typically 16) cannot exceed 32.
 *    Thus Nh should be 16.  The largest filter coefficient should nearly
 *    fill 16 bits (32767).
 *
 * Nb - is the number of bits in the input data. The sum of Nb and Nh cannot
 *    exceed 32.
 *
 * Nhxn - is the number of bits to right shift after multiplying each input
 *    sample times a filter coefficient. It can be as great as Nh and as
 *    small as 0. Nhxn = Nh-2 gives 2 guard bits in the multiply-add
 *    accumulation.  If Nhxn=0, the accumulation will soon overflow 32 bits.
 *
 * Nhg - is the number of guard bits in mpy-add accumulation (equal to Nh-Nhxn)
 *
 * NLpScl - is the number of bits allocated to the unity-gain normalization
 *    factor.  The output of the lowpass filter is multiplied by LpScl and
 *    then right-shifted NLpScl bits. To avoid overflow, we must have 
 *    Nb+Nhg+NLpScl < 32.

		/* Okay chaps, here's how we do resampling.
		 *
		 * The original resample algorithm requires xoff samples *before* the
		 * input buffer as history, and another xoff samples *after* the
		 * end of the input buffer as lookahead. Since application can only
		 * supply framesize buffer on each run, PJMEDIA needs to arrange the
		 * buffer to meet these requirements.
		 *
		 * So here comes the trick.
		 *
		 * First of all, because of the history and lookahead requirement, 
		 * m_buffer need to accomodate framesize+2*xoff samples in its
		 * buffer. This is done when the buffer is created.
		 *
		 * On the first run, the input frame (supplied by application) is
		 * copied to m_buffer at 2*xoff position. The first 2*xoff
		 * samples are initially zeroed (in the initialization). The resample
		 * algorithm then invoked at m_buffer+xoff ONLY, thus giving
		 * it one xoff at the beginning as zero, and one xoff at the end
		 * as the end of the original input. The resample algorithm will see
		 * that the first xoff samples in the input as zero.
		 *
		 * So here's the layout of m_buffer on the first run.
		 *
		 * run 0 
		 *     +------+------+--------------+
		 *     | 0000 | 0000 |  frame0...   |
		 *     +------+------+--------------+
		 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
			 *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
			 *
		 * (Note again: resample algorithm is called at m_buffer+xoff)
		 *
		 * At the end of the run, 2*xoff samples from the end of 
		 * m_buffer are copied to the beginning of m_buffer.
		 * The first xoff part of this will be used as history for the next
		 * run, and the second xoff part of this is actually the start of
		 * resampling for the next run.
		 *
		 * And the first run completes, the function returns.
		 *
		 * 
		 * On the next run, the input frame supplied by application is again
		 * copied at 2*xoff position in the m_buffer, and the 
		 * resample algorithm is again invoked at m_buffer+xoff 
		 * position. So effectively, the resample algorithm will start its
		 * operation on the last xoff from the previous frame, and gets the
		 * history from the last 2*xoff of the previous frame, and the look-
		 * ahead from the last xoff of current frame.
		 *
		 * So on this run, the buffer layout is:
		 *
		 * run 1
		 *     +------+------+--------------+
		 *     | frm0 | frm0 |  frame1...   |
		 *     +------+------+--------------+
		 *     ^      ^      ^              ^
			 *     0    xoff  2*xoff       size+2*xoff 
		 *
		 * As you can see from above diagram, the resampling algorithm is
		 * actually called from the last xoff part of previous frame (frm0).
		 *
		 * And so on the process continues for the next frame, and the next,
		 * and the next, ...
		 *
